## LAB 0

This program takes two integer values from the user and stores it to two created variables named 'jack' and 'jill'. The first operation prints out the values of the two variables. Then, the program swaps the values of the two variables, and then the program prints out the new values.

## LAB 1

This NASM assembly program solves a logical puzzle by computing a five-digit code based on specific clues. The puzzle involves the sum of the first two digits equaling 8, the difference between the second and fifth digits equaling the fourth digit, and the middle digit being the quotient of the product of the first and last digits divided by 6. The program systematically computes the values of each digit: the first digit is 3, the second is 5, the fifth is 4, the fourth is 1, and the third is 2. These values are derived using arithmetic operations, and the final code `35214` is displayed. The program demonstrates efficient use of assembly language for problem-solving, utilizing basic control flow, arithmetic, and output formatting.
