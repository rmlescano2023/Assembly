## LAB 0

This assembly program for NASM allows a user to input two integer values into variables named 'jack' and 'jill', then displays their values, swaps the two variables, and prints the new values. The program is structured into three main phases: taking input from the user, printing the initial values ("Before the fall"), and swapping the values of 'jack' and 'jill' before printing the swapped values ("After the fall"). It uses basic input/output operations, arithmetic, and data movement to accomplish the task, demonstrating foundational assembly programming concepts like variable manipulation and stack management.

## LAB 1

This program solves a logical puzzle by computing a five-digit code based on specific clues. The puzzle involves the sum of the first two digits equaling 8, the difference between the second and fifth digits equaling the fourth digit, and the middle digit being the quotient of the product of the first and last digits divided by 6. The program systematically computes the values of each digit: the first digit is 3, the second is 5, the fifth is 4, the fourth is 1, and the third is 2. These values are derived using arithmetic operations, and the final code `35214` is displayed. The program demonstrates efficient use of assembly language for problem-solving, utilizing basic control flow, arithmetic, and output formatting.

## LAB 2

This assembly program checks whether a given year is a leap year based on user input. It mirrors the functionality of the C program that evaluates leap years using the following conditions:

* If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
* If the year is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it is not a leap year.
* If the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, it is a leap year.
* Any other case means the year is not a leap year.
The program prompts the user to enter a year, performs division to check for leap year conditions, and prints the corresponding message. It uses division operations and conditional jumps to control the flow based on the remainders of the division. The results are printed based on whether the year meets the criteria for being a leap year or not.
